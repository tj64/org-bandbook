* Abstract

"Jazz at Massey Hall is a live jazz album featuring a performance by
\"The Quintet\" given on 15 May 1953 at Massey Hall in Toronto. The
quintet was composed of several leading 'modern' players of the day:
Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, Charles Mingus, and Max
Roach. It was the only time that the five men recorded together as a
unit, and it was the last recorded meeting of Parker and Gillespie.
